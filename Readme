I have covered most of the features that are required to be done in the assignment.
The features are:

adding contact
search contact- search through name as well as through email
pagination(4 contacts per page)
order by desc
order bt asc
order by name
deleting the contact if the name matches 




I have used PHP and MySQL database 

database name- one
table name- phno
name is a primary key 

However, I have tried to host the project 

www.phonebkproj.tk

bought this domain from - freenom
and hosted on awardspace

NOTE: I didn't checked the domain... as it takes time to get hosted.... I was unable to check it...
sorry if the hosted link does not work... 


thankyou very much for considering me 

with regards- Arun Veebhuti
